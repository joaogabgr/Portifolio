## About Me

I am a passionate software developer focusing my studies on **Spring** and **Java**, while also having knowledge of other programming languages and frameworks such as **Python**, **TypeScript**, and **React**. My primary focus is on **back-end development**, although I also possess experience in front-end technologies.

### Academic Experience

Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in several team projects using the **SCRUM** methodology, which has provided me with valuable experience in collaborative work:

- **Nephrology Project**: In my first semester, I worked on a project where we developed a website using **Flask (Python)** to provide useful information for mothers.
- **Service Desk Project**: During my second semester, I contributed to creating a service desk website and API, developed with **Node.js (TypeScript)** and **React**, allowing students to report issues related to the college.
- **FAPG Foundation Project**: Currently, in my third semester, I am working on a project for the **FAPG Foundation** - Foundation for the Support of Graduate Research, focusing on creating a transparency portal.

### Personal Projects

In addition to my academic experiences, I am also engaged in ongoing personal projects that reflect my interest in deepening my knowledge and practical skills in software development:

- **Authentication API**: An authentication API built with **Spring** and **TypeScript (Node.js)** using **JWT**.
- **Library System API**: An API for a library system that also utilizes **Spring**.
