            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I have been focusing my studies on <u>Spring and Java</u>, while also having knowledge of other languages and frameworks such as <u>Python, TypeScript, and React.</u> My primary focus has been on back-end development, although I also have experience in front-end.</p>
            <p>So far, I have participated in several team projects using the SCRUM methodology, which provided me with valuable experience in collaborative work. In my first semester, I worked on a nephrology project, where we developed a website using <u>Flask (Python)</u> to provide useful information for mothers. In my second semester, I contributed to the creation of a service desk website and API, developed with <u>Node.js (TypeScript) and React,</u> allowing students to report issues related to the college. Currently, in my third semester, I am working on a project for the FAPG Foundation - Foundation for the Support of Graduate Research, focused on creating a transparency portal.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic experiences, I have ongoing personal projects. One of them is an authentication API built with <u>Spring and TypeScript (Node.js) using JWT</u>, and another is an API for a library system, also utilizing <u>Spring.</u> These projects reflect my interest in deepening my knowledge and practical skills in software development.</p>
